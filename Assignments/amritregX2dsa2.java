      * X2 Cycle with given vertex.
      *
      * Write an algorithm that returns a cycle of an undirected graph that
      * contains a given vertex. Parameters are a graph and vertex v, and the
      * return value is a list of vertices (LinkedList<Vertex>) of one cycle
      * that contains vertex v, or null if there is no such cycle.  The
      * elements in the list must be in order of the cycle. The vertex v must thus
      * be the first and the last element of the list. What is the time
      * complexity of your algorithm?
      *
      * You can make more methods, but DO NOT CHANGE the header of this method.
      *
      * @param G the input undirected graph
      * @param v the vertex that is required to be part of the cycle
      * @return vertices of one cycle that contains v, or null of no cycle exists

	/*
	 * I used depth first search to solve the problem.
	 * First I colored the graph white  
	 * I added each visited element  in the linked list and
	 * set it black except the given(which is first one on the list)
	 * if current element is equal to given element and size of the list >1  then we have detected the cycle 
	 * then we stop looking and stop iterating over neighbors else we continue at the end of each recursion tree 
	 * if the last element added on the list is not equal to given then we remove it from the  list.
	 * This algorithm will not work in all cases if the graph is directed graph.
	 * 
	 *  It could be done similarly by dfs over the edges (efficient method If it is a directed graph). 
	 * 
	 * It would be more efficient if we could be able to return the value to the main method and end the recursion abruptly
	 * after we detect the cycle rather than going through remaining neighbors.(I think I somehow fixed it) I had trouble 
	 * figuring that out, also I stumbled quite a long time as I was able to print the cycle when there was a match but 
	 * the already running recursion modified my list (even though i had the match).
	 * 
	 * The time complexity of my algorithm will be < O(v+e) as I visit only some vertices+edges until we find the cycle.
